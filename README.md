Creating a basic Node.Js project template alongwith some best practices. 


`For NodeJs best practices I am referring:`

https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices#3-code-style-practices

## ![✔] 1 Name your functions

**TL;DR:** Name all functions, including closures and callbacks. Avoid anonymous functions. This is especially useful when profiling a node app. Naming all functions will allow you to easily understand what you're looking at when checking a memory snapshot

**Otherwise:** Debugging production issues using a core dump (memory snapshot) might become challenging as you notice significant memory consumption from anonymous functions

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 2 Require modules first, not inside functions

**TL;DR:** Require modules at the beginning of each file, before and outside of any functions. This simple best practice will not only help you easily and quickly tell the dependencies of a file right at the top but also avoids a couple of potential problems

**Otherwise:** Requires are run synchronously by Node.js. If they are called from within a function, it may block other requests from being handled at a more critical time. Also, if a required module or any of its own dependencies throw an error and crash the server, it is best to find out about it as soon as possible, which might not be the case if that module is required from within a function

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 3 Require modules by folders, opposed to the files directly

**TL;DR:** When developing a module/library in a folder, place an index.js file that exposes the module's internals so every consumer will pass through it. This serves as an 'interface' to your module and eases future changes without breaking the contract

**Otherwise:** Changing the internal structure of files or the signature may break the interface with clients

### 3 Code example

```javascript
// Do
module.exports.SMSProvider = require('./SMSProvider');
module.exports.SMSNumberResolver = require('./SMSNumberResolver');

// Avoid
module.exports.SMSProvider = require('./SMSProvider/SMSProvider.js');
module.exports.SMSNumberResolver = require('./SMSNumberResolver/SMSNumberResolver.js');
```

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 4 Use the `===` operator

**TL;DR:** Prefer the strict equality operator `===` over the weaker abstract equality operator `==`. `==` will compare two variables after converting them to a common type. There is no type conversion in `===`, and both variables must be of the same type to be equal

**Otherwise:** Unequal variables might return true when compared with the `==` operator

### 4 Code example

```javascript
'' == '0'           // false
0 == ''             // true
0 == '0'            // true

false == 'false'    // false
false == '0'        // true

false == undefined  // false
false == null       // false
null == undefined   // true

' \t\r\n ' == 0     // true
```

All statements above will return false if used with `===`

<br/><br/>

## ![✔] 5 Use Async Await, avoid callbacks

**TL;DR:** Node 8 LTS now has full support for Async-await. This is a new way of dealing with asynchronous code which supersedes callbacks and promises. Async-await is non-blocking, and it makes asynchronous code look synchronous. The best gift you can give to your code is using async-await which provides a much more compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch

**Otherwise:** Handling async errors in callback style is probably the fastest way to hell - this style forces to check errors all over, deal with awkward code nesting and makes it difficult to reason about the code flow

## ![✔] 6 Use arrow function expressions (=>)

**TL;DR:** Though it's recommended to use async-await and avoid function parameters when dealing with older APIs that accept promises or callbacks - arrow functions make the code structure more compact and keep the lexical context of the root function (i.e. `this`)

**Otherwise:** Longer code (in ES5 functions) is more prone to bugs and cumbersome to read
